<br><br>
With this in mind, we're delighted to announce the NodeConf London scholarship, which makes available a number of tickets at no cost.
</p><h4>Who's eligible</h4><p>The scholarship is available to anyone not normally able to attend a conference.
<br><br>
Some of the groups we are especially keen to support include the following:
</p><ul><li>LGBTQIA+</li><li>Ethnic minorities</li><li>Women</li><li>Disabled people</li><li>Charity workers</li><li>Educational workers and students</li></ul><h4>How to Apply</h4><p>Send us an email telling us a bit about:
</p><ul><li>Who you are.</li><li>What you do.</li><li>A few words detailing why you would like the scholarship.</li></ul><p><a href="mailto:ian.crowther@nearform.com?subject=NodeConf London Scholarship" class="button">Apply now</a></p><p>Please note that successful applicants will get a single standard conference ticket.
<br><br>
All emails will be treated in the strictest confidence, we will not announce who the scholarships go to but you’re welcome to say so yourself.
<br><br>
We are only able to cover the cost of the conference ticket so please consider your travel costs before applying.
<br><br>
